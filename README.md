## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prem1kr/smart-video-tracker.git
cd smart-video-tracker
```

---

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside `backend/`:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

Start backend:
```bash
npm start
```

---

### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start frontend:
```bash
npm start
```

App runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Backend:
- `authController.js`: Handles login/signup with JWT tokens.
- `videoController.js`: Saves watched time intervals to MongoDB.
- `Progress.js`: Stores video watch intervals per user.
- `server.js`: Main Express server that connects routes and DB.

### Frontend:
- `Login.jsx` & `Signup.jsx`: Auth pages.
- `VideoPlayer.jsx`: 
  - Tracks which parts of the video were watched.
  - Sends updates to backend every few seconds.
  - Resumes playback from the last watched interval.
- `video.mp4`: Local video used for testing (can be replaced).

---

## üì¶ Deployment

If deploying to a platform like Vercel or Netlify for frontend and Render for backend:

1. **Frontend**: Run `npm run build` inside `frontend` and push the contents of `./build`.
2. **Backend**: Deploy using services like Render or Railway, and set environment variables.

---

## üìå Design Decisions

- **Custom Video Progress Tracking**: Instead of using browser's default progress, we track "watched intervals" and ignore skipped parts.
- **Resumable Playback**: When a user returns, the last saved interval is fetched and played.
- **Separate Backend/Frontend**: Easier deployment and scalability.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure and stateless token-based login system.

---

## ‚ú® Future Improvements

- Add multiple video support.
- Include user dashboard to show progress analytics.
- Add roles (admin, viewer) for content management.

## Explanation ;- 

Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs a detailed explanation covering:

- **How watched intervals are tracked**
- **How intervals are merged to calculate unique progress**
- **Challenges faced and how they were solved**
---

## üéØ How Watched Intervals Are Tracked

In the **VideoPlayer.jsx**, we use the `onTimeUpdate` event to frequently track the video‚Äôs `currentTime` and whether the user is actually watching or skipping.

### Basic Flow:
```jsx
videoRef.current.currentTime; // gives current playback time
```

We:
- Poll the video every second
- Store `startTime` when video is playing
- Store `endTime` when the user pauses, seeks, or ends the video
- Save that interval as `{ start: Number, end: Number }`

Then we send that data to the backend using Axios like:

```js
POST /api/video/progress
{
  intervals: [
    { start: 10, end: 20 },
    { start: 22, end: 30 },
    ...
  ]
}
```

> üîê Intervals are stored *per user*, so users can resume individually.

---

## üß† How Watched Intervals Are Merged

We don‚Äôt just add time differences directly ‚Äî that would double-count overlapping or repeated segments.

Instead, we **merge overlapping intervals** to calculate **unique progress**.

### Example:
```js
Input Intervals:
[{ start: 0, end: 10 }, { start: 8, end: 15 }, { start: 16, end: 20 }]

Merged Intervals:
[{ start: 0, end: 15 }, { start: 16, end: 20 }]
```

### Backend Logic (Simplified in videoController.js):
```js
function mergeIntervals(intervals) {
  if (!intervals.length) return [];

  intervals.sort((a, b) => a.start - b.start);

  const merged = [intervals[0]];

  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const last = merged[merged.length - 1];
    const current = intervals[i];

    if (current.start <= last.end) {
      last.end = Math.max(last.end, current.end);
    } else {
      merged.push(current);
    }
  }

  return merged;
}
```

Then to calculate percentage watched:
```js
const totalWatched = merged.reduce((sum, i) => sum + (i.end - i.start), 0);
const percentWatched = (totalWatched / videoDuration) * 100;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. **Users Skipping Videos**
**Problem**: Users could just drag the video to the end to get full progress.

**Solution**:
- I ignored intervals less than 2 seconds (to prevent fast skips).
- Only saved intervals if the user watched at least N seconds.
- Tracked *actual time watched* rather than current video position.

---

### 2. **Overlapping Intervals**
**Problem**: Watching the same segment multiple times inflated the progress.

**Solution**: 
- I merged overlapping intervals on the backend before calculating total time watched.
- Ensured no segment is counted twice.

---

### 3. **Syncing with MongoDB**
**Problem**: Frequent requests on every second caused DB performance issues.

**Solution**:
- Debounced updates: Sent to backend every few seconds instead of constantly.
- Only sent new intervals when the user paused, exited, or hit certain milestones.

---

### 4. **Video Resumption**
**Problem**: User closed browser and came back later; video started from beginning.

**Solution**:
- On login, I fetched the user‚Äôs last saved intervals.
- On video mount, I set `videoRef.current.currentTime` to the last saved `end`.
